## React Router 4

This is a simple React app using React router v4 for a few static pages. It is just a just purely for testing out some router components with a few pages. This exercise would be used to as a basic knowledge to build a fully functional frontend 
React application.

The React app is also added with reactstrap and bootstrap4 alpha.6. Again, this is to test the plugin readiness.

This repo currently contain a few static pages and is built upon a number of react components. All the pages are styled with Bootstrap 4 and some custom css.
